# Overview

I used this project to gain and deepen my understanding of the Kotlin lanuage.

I created a Blackjack game with Kotlin. It allows a user to play blackjack without real rist. The player will enter their name and the money they have. If you lose you lose the money you bet. If you win you double your bet. If you run out of money you are not able to continue playing.

I decided to do this because I was able to use a lot of different logic operators, classes, and many of Kotlins availible elements.
